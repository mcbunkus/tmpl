# tmpl

tmpl is a simple command line tool for generating files from a TOML template spec.
It's useful for generating project boilerplate and commonly used files, such as
markdown notes, script boilerplate, etc.

I originally implemented this in Go, and left it on the shelf when it did what
I wanted well enough. I revisited the project with fresh eyes and saw some
improvements I could make. I decided to rewrite it in Rust because I don't
see myself writing Go professionally, and my Rust is very rusty.
That's why I have 2 tmpl projects.
