Generate a project from a given yaml template. For example:

	tmpl generate <template-name> # tmpl gen <template-name> works too

will produce a new project in the current directory. Templates
consist of nested file and directory declarations. An example 
template can be generated using the make command. Run 

	tmpl make <template-name> # or tmpl mk <template-name>

to produce an example yaml template file. You can open it in 
your editor quickly with:

	tmpl edit <template-name>

if you have an EDITOR environment variable set.
